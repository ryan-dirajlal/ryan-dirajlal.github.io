<h1>Correlation of Current Party Controlling the White House & Midterm Congressional Elections</h1>
<div id="barChart"></div>
<div id="footer">As we saw in the Parallel Coordinates Graph, the Midterm Elections and General Congressional Elections
do not always correlate to the outcome of the presidential election. However, I argue that although we cannot predict presidential
elections from midterm election results, we *can* predict midterm election results with which party currently controls the
executive branch. This can be seen in the bar graph above, where the party of the current president almost always loses
    seats in the House of Representatives in the following midterm election, no matter the current president's approval rating.
The higher the approval rating of a president, the less seats his party will lose, but it will almost certainly result in a
net loss of some amount. Thus, we can predict the outcome of midterm election based on the current president, but not vice versa.
This results in my hypothesis that America tends to stay moderate and welcomes change very slowly. This is why we see a "pushback"
of a president's party in the midterm elections; the American electorate realizes they need the competing party to keep the President's
party "in check."</div>
